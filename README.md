# BikeStore_Sales_Dashboard

This is a tableau dashboard project where I have generated the data using sql server and I have used sql queries to clean and extract the required data and then uploaded it as an excel file.
After that, visualization are done using tableau to create a dashboard which gives sales insights of the Bike Store.

Here is the link to my dashboard -
